## Importance of Data Structures
A computer program largely resolves around data. A computer program is all about a
receiving, manipulating and returning data. A data structures refer to how data is
organized. Depending on how you choose to organize your data, your program may run
faster or slower by orders of Magnitude.

### The Array
An array is a fundamental data structure in computer science. Array used is used to
store list of data elements. The **index** of an array is the number that represent
position of an element in the array. In most programming languages, we begin counting
the index at 0 ends counting at `n-1`

Example in python:
```python
groceries_array = ["Apple", "Honey", "Orage", "Banana"]
```

**Most data structures are used in four basic ways**:
- **Read**: Reading refers to looking something up from a particular spot within the data structure.
